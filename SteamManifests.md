# Steam Manifest Commands
Using these steam commands, you can download any/all version of Shipbreaker you want, as long as you own the game. While Steam is
running, run [this](https://github.com/fifty-six/zig.SteamManifestPatcher/releases/download/v3.2/SteamDepotDownpatcher.exe) executable, which unblocks the ability to download old game versions. Open run (`Win + R`), and input `steam://open/console`.
This will open the Steam console, from which you can run the commands seen below. For whatever reason, it takes a ridiculous amount of time
to download from this console, so be prepared to wait an extra long time.

After the download is done, it'll be in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\content\app_1161580\depot_1161581`. Find the location of your
Shipbreaker files by right-clicking it in the Library, and going to `Properties > Local Files > Browse`. You ***must*** delete the game files
in here, and paste in the files you just downloaded. If you run the old version from anywhere else, it won't work (Steam is funky sometimes).

Now, here's a list of commands to download any version of Shipbreaker:
