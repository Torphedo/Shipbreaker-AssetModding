I've compiled a list of all internal Unity scene names and how they match to compiled scene files.
This information is accurate as of 0.6.0 (hotfix 2).

```master                     = level0
master_game_container      = level1
master_audio_container     = level2
base_session_container     = level3
master_frontend            = level4
SC_QABed                   = level5
empty                      = level6
elemental_test             = level7
SC_Salvage_Bay_Small       = level8
SC_Jack_Small_Shrunk       = level9
SC_Subsystem_Test          = level10
splash_screen              = level11
Decoupled_Hab              = level12
SC_SpaceTruckHABCameraRoom = level13
