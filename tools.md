[Sariya](https://github.com/sariyamelody)'s [Salvage Data Extractor](https://github.com/hssb-racers/hssb-pricelist-generator): A command-line tool that takes a decompiled copy of Shipbreaker as input, and prints the value of every item in the game to the console. You'll have to copy the console output and paste it in a text file.
Usage: Takes the `\Assets\ScriptableObject` folder of your decompiled Shipbreaker as input.

For example: `hssb-pricelist-generator.exe E:\datamining\Shipbreaker\0.6.0\Shipbreaker\Assets\ScriptableObject`

To obtain a decompiled copy of Shipbreaker, use [uTinyRipper](https://sourceforge.net/projects/utinyripper/files/).
