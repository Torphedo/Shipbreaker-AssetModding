# Shipbreaker Asset Mods
This repo hosts my mods for Hardspace: Shipbreaker that edit assets, such as textures. These are hosted as `*.emip` files, which can be created using [UABE](https://github.com/DerPopo/UABE). I've also hosted a batch script I made to install these files, which I've made as easy to use and expandable as I can.
