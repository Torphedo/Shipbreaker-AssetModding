# Shipbreaker Asset Mods
This repo hosts my mods for Hardspace: Shipbreaker that edit assets, such as textures. These are hosted as `*.emip` files, which can be created using [UABE](https://github.com/DerPopo/UABE). I've also included a batch script I made to install these files, which I've made as easy to use and expandable as I can.

## Script Usage:
Download the batch script from the [releases](https://github.com/Torphedo/Shipbreaker-AssetModding/releases) tab, then place it in the Shipbreaker directory (next to `Shipbreaker.exe`). When run for the first time, it will download all the `*.emip` and `*.xdelta` mod files it needs directly from this repo, along with a copy of UABE and xdelta to apply them. When prompted, pick what mod you want to install, and the script will do it for you.
