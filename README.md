# Shipbreaker Asset Mods
This repo hosts my mods for Hardspace: Shipbreaker that edit assets, such as textures. These are hosted as `*.emip` files, which can be created using [UABE](https://github.com/DerPopo/UABE). I've also hosted a batch script I made to install these files, which I've made as easy to use and expandable as I can.

Script Usage:
Place batch script in the Shipbreaker directory, next to Shipbreaker.exe. When run for the first time, it will download all the `*.emip` mod files it needs directly from this repo, along with a copy of UABE to apply them. When prompted, pick what mod you want to install, and the script will install it for you.
